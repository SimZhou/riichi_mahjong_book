# Mahjong Site Rebuild Notes

## Current Branch

- This branch rebuilds the site from scratch from locally mirrored Japanese source pages.
- Source content lives under `site_src/`.
- Built static output must land in `docs/` for GitHub Pages deployment.
- Raw mirrored source and assets live under `raw_site/`.

## Key Directories

- `site_src/docs/`: translated Chinese markdown pages
- `site_src/mkdocs.yml`: MkDocs config for the rebuilt site
- `docs/`: deployable static site output
- `raw_site/articles/`: local snapshots of original Japanese article bodies
- `raw_site/assets/`: mirrored original images and other assets
- `scripts/build_site.sh`: canonical build entrypoint

## Build Rules

- Always build with:

```bash
scripts/build_site.sh
```

- Do not build into any directory other than `docs/`.
- Acceptance must be based on generated `docs/`, not only markdown source.

## Translation Rules

- Translate from local Japanese source snapshots under `raw_site/articles/`.
- Do not use external translation APIs.
- Keep the original article logic, example order, and conclusion structure aligned with the Japanese source.
- Keep the page-end source link:

```md
原始日文页：<http://beginners.biz/...>
```

## Diagram Rules

- Article diagrams are mandatory content, not decoration.
- For each page, compare original `../images/...` references against:
  - `site_src/docs/...`
  - generated `docs/...`
- If the original page contains an article diagram, the translated page must also contain it.
- Decorative assets outside article content are lower priority than article diagrams.

## Regression Checklist

For page-by-page review, always check all three items:

1. Whether article diagrams are missing
2. Whether translation meaning is wrong or drifted
3. Whether layout has defects

Minimum review flow:

1. Compare `raw_site/articles/<page>.html` with `site_src/docs/<page>.md`
2. Compare original `../images/...` references with generated `docs/<page>.html`
3. Check generated HTML heading structure and page-end source link
4. Check for residual Japanese kana in translated markdown

## Tile River Table Rule

- Some original pages render discard examples as very compact two-row HTML tables:
  - first row: `例N` plus `↓` markers for tsumogiri
  - second row: tile images only
- Treat those tables as article content, not generic data tables. Preserve the table structure, but do not rely on default MkDocs/Material table styling.
- Do not put Markdown image syntax like `![tile](...)` directly inside raw HTML table cells. In this project, that can pass through as literal text in generated HTML instead of becoming `<img>`.
- For tile river example tables inside raw HTML:
  - use real `<img ...>` tags inside `<td>`
  - wrap the table in a compact container such as `.river-block`
  - use the dedicated `.river-table` styling from `site_src/docs/stylesheets/extra.css`
- Purpose of the dedicated river-table styling:
  - keep the original compact old-site look
  - avoid Material's default full-width table spacing
  - allow horizontal scrolling on narrow screens instead of crushing tile images
- When a page contains these discard-example tables, add an explicit layout check after build:
  1. inspect generated `docs/<page>.html` and confirm the cells contain `<img>` tags, not literal `![...]`
  2. confirm `river-block` / `river-table` classes are present in generated HTML
  3. visually check that the example block is compact and readable on both desktop width and narrow width
  4. if reviewing live, confirm the deployed page preserves the compact layout rather than expanded generic table styling

## Live Sampling Checklist

- Local `docs/` being correct does not prove the deployed site is correct.
- After meaningful batches, sample deployed pages on `https://simzhou.com/mahjong_beginner/`.
- Live sampling should verify:
  - page returns real article content, not `404`
  - article diagrams load on the deployed domain
  - page-end source link is present

- Treat network resets and TLS failures separately from confirmed content failures.
- A page that consistently returns `404 - Not found` on the live domain is a real deployment issue, not a transient fetch error.

## Current Sampling Findings

Sampled live pages confirmed normal:

- `kihon/kihon08.html`
- `teyaku/teyaku07.html`
- `dora/dora04.html`
- `naki/naki12.html`
- `reach/reach04.html`
- `osihiki/osihiki02.html`

Confirmed live deployment issue:

- `https://simzhou.com/mahjong_beginner/joukyou/joukyou09.html`
  - currently returns `404 - Not found`
  - local `docs/joukyou/joukyou09.html` exists and is tracked
  - this indicates a live deployment mismatch or stale publish state, not a missing local build artifact

## Deployment Verification Update

- The earlier live `404` on `joukyou/joukyou09.html` was caused by GitHub Pages not yet pointing to this branch's `docs/`.
- After Pages was switched to this branch's `docs/`, live sampling confirmed the rebuilt site is now being served.

Rechecked live pages confirmed normal:

- `joukyou/joukyou09.html`
- `reach/reach04.html`
- `mamori/mamori12.html`
- `naki/naki12.html`
- `dora/dora04.html`
- `teyaku/teyaku07.html`
- `pairi/pairi20.html`

For those pages, live checks confirmed:

1. article page renders instead of `404`
2. article diagrams load on the deployed domain
3. page-end source link is present
4. no Japanese kana residue detected in sampled HTML

## Practical Rule

- When the user reports a live page problem, verify the deployed URL first.
- Do not assume that because `docs/` is correct locally, the live site is already updated.
